                    <p class="card-text">Spooked witnesses visiting Lookout Point have reported seeing the ghostly apparition of an elderly woman looking out to sea with her hair blowing in the wind.  They describe her as wearing a shawl, long skirt and boots.  Some witnesses also report hearing the sounds of a woman crying.  As they approach the distressed ghostly woman she disappears into thin air.  The elderly ghost is believed to be the spirit of a heartbroken grandmother from a local fishing family whose menfolk were all tragically drowned during a terrible storm in 1701.  It’s said that she haunts Lookout Point because she’s waiting to be reunited with her family!</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Spooked witnesses walking along the Waterloo Passage have reported seeing the ghostly apparition of a little girl.  They describe her as being dressed in ragged clothes and having her hair in braids.  She seems to be happy though, as she sings and skips along the passageway!

It’s said that she fell into the River Bourne and drowned after being chased by local traders from whom she stole some apples.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Local legend says that the churchyard of All Saints Church is haunted by a ghost of a former priest.  In the early part of the 19th century a young priest was caught red handed burying a sack full of gold coins, belonging to local smugglers, in the churchyard.  For his crime of helping the smugglers he was hanged on the beach!  Before he was hanged he confessed that only half of the smugglers' gold coins had been found.  It’s now said that if you’re brave enough to venture into the churchyard after dark, the ghost of the young priest will show you where the gold coins are buried!</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Guests staying in the upstairs rooms of the inn have reported seeing a ghostly female figure leaning over them when they’ve woken in the middle of the night.  They describe her as wearing a big floppy hat.  Strangely, they say that they never felt afraid - in fact they report feeling calm, reassured and fell quickly back into a peaceful sleep!  The ghostly woman is believed to be the spirit of a former nanny of the house who would watch over the family’s children while they slept.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">In the past whenever there’s been alteration done to the pub the builders have reported paranormal activity taking place.  They reported that their tools would be mysteriously moved or go missing.  And on a couple of occasions they even witnessed puffs of smoke where nobody had been smoking.  The ghostly goings-on are believed to be caused by the ghost of the original architect of the building.  It’s said that he keeps his eye on the building and makes sure no harm comes to its historical architecture!</p>

                    <p class="card-text">In 1812 a young local fisherman called Joseph Swaine was mistaken for a smuggler and shot dead by a customs officer.  Joseph’s ghost is now said to haunt the Lord Nelson pub and the surrounding streets.  Both members of staff and customers alike have reported seeing his ghostly apparition within the pub.  Sometimes they've seen his ghost walking through the pub’s back wall!  They describe his ghostly apparition as being a young scruffy looking lad dressed in a fishing tunic and hat.  His apparition is often occupied by a sudden drop in temperature and a strange smell.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Spooked witnesses have reported seeing the ghostly apparition of a young elegant woman within the theatre.  They describe her as being a tall young woman wearing fine clothing from the early 19th century.  Local legend says the ghostly lady is the spirit of a daughter of a well-to-do Hastings family who fell in love with a young British soldier stationed at the building during the Napoleonic Wars.  Sadly the young soldier was sent to battle and was killed in action.  After hearing the tragic news his fiancée committed suicide by throwing herself off the cliffs at Fairlight.  It’s now said that the Pretty Ghost will glide across the stage at the theatre on the opening night of a production if it’s going to be a success!</p>

                    <p class="card-text">A shocked witness once saw a ball of light ascend the library’s staircase.  As it reached the top it changed into a ghostly apparition of a man.  The witness described the ghostly man as being in his mid-thirties, carrying a walking cane and being well-dressed in a coat, suit, gloves and hat.  He had styled dark hair and a twisted moustache.  As the ghostly man reached the top of the stairs he disappeared into thin air!  Some believe that the ghostly man is the spirit of one of the founders of the Brassey Institute.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Spooked members of staff and theatre-goers alike have reported seeing the ghostly apparition of a female figure hurrying around the building.  They describe her as being an old fashioned nurse who looks like she's carrying someone in her arms.  She wears a long skirt with a white apron and cap.  The White Rock Theatre was actually built on the site of the original East Sussex hospital.  The theatre’s Sussex Room was built on the area which was once the hospital’s mortuary room.  And this is the area where the ghostly nurse is often seen walking through walls!</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Spooked witnesses walking along the top of West Hill cliffs have reported seeing a ghostly apparition of a young lady.  They describe her as wearing a period style, light coloured dress and carrying a baby.  To their horror, they then witness her running towards the cliff edge and disappearing over it!  Local legend says she’s the ghost of a young woman from a well-to-do family who became pregnant out of wedlock.  To cover up the scandal her family sent her to a convent to have the child intending the baby to then be put up for adoption after she gave birth to it.  But after she gave birth to the child the young mother became very attached to it.  When she saw her father coming to the convent to collect her she panicked and fled.  Eventually she reached West Hill where she tragically decided to jump off it's cliff edge with her baby rather than be parted from it.  The young lady died but the baby actually survived the fall.  The woman’s grieving family decided to bring her child up as their own.</p>
